Gives you long quizzes but waste a great portion of class time explaining materials not covered in the quiz. Sometimes he tests you on materials he hasn't yet covered in class.

He still works as a project manager full-time so he has interesting insight into the field. Great slides that follow the textbook. Straightforward exams. Overall, a nice fair guy with a somewhat dry course, but u can actually learn so"

However, a lot of people found him/the TAs to be hard markers. I think I only did well because I have a writing style similar to his and went to his office hours before each paper."

Going to lectures did not really help since she is reading her slides for most of it, although she sometimes gave cues about what would be in the exam. Also lots of reading to do but I realized that the important info is in the power points, so I assume you can survive without reading"

Above all, Dario is super passionate about his field, which translates into the lectures. His classes are rarely boring and worth attending, even if attendance isn' t mandatory. TAKE THIS PROF!!"

Lectures were 60 pages long slides, with information bulldozed on you and expectations to memorise each word, because his MCQ questions were made by him that way."

Midterm and final are both jokes, hardest part is the lab exam, make sure you go to the lab review. He tells you exactly what you need to know to pass. Textbook is useless besides a few definitions needed for the exam."

The midterms were nice and manageable. Didn't enjoy the class much at first but as time went on he became more relaxed and even funny. Nothing to worry about, would recommend."
