# Rate My Professor AI Assistant

This project showcases the implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to assist users in finding information about professors and courses. By leveraging technologies like **Next.js, React, Pinecone,** and the **OpenAI API**, the AI assistant efficiently retrieves relevant data from a vector database and generates context-aware responses using a language model.

Key features of the project include:
- **Integration of RAG**: Combining retrieval-based and generative AI approaches to enhance response accuracy.
- **Vector Database**: Utilizing Pinecone for storing and retrieving data embeddings.
- **Modern Frontend**: Built with Next.js and React, providing a seamless user interface.

The project serves as a practical example of how to build AI-powered applications that require access to specific, up-to-date information.
